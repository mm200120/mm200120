## Selected Projects

### Programming & Data Projects
- **Energy Consumption Prediction** — Predicts household energy consumption using historical temperature and time data to support load optimisation and energy planning. https://github.com/mm200120/Project-1-Energy-Consumption-Prediction  
- **Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning** — Applies ML to industrial sensor data to forecast equipment failures and reduce downtime. https://github.com/mm200120/Project_2_Predictive_Maintenance 
- **Freshwater Withdrawals Analysis System (FWAS)** — Data analysis and visualization tool for freshwater withdrawal trends; suitable for environmental research and policy analysis. https://github.com/mm200120/Freshwater-Withdrawals-Analysis-System

- **AI-Powered Water Crisis Prediction System** — Uses World Bank datasets with ML clustering and anomaly detection to identify countries at risk of water stress. https://github.com/mm200120/Developing-System-for-Freshwater-Withdrawals-Analysis/blob/main/readme.md
  
-**Maatla Workouts** - is a professional and visually polished fitness web application designed to encourage healthier and more active lifestyles. The application is developed using Python with the Flask web framework, a SQLite database for data storage, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end. https://github.com/code50/194095445/blob/main/cs50x/finalproject1/maatla_workouts/README.md
- **The Smart Expense Tracker** - is a command-line Python application designed to help users track and manage personal expenses efficiently. The program allows users to record expenses with descriptions, categories, amounts, and dates, store them persistently, and analyze their spending habits. https://github.com/code50/194095445/tree/main/python/final_project

### Engineering Projects
- **Final Year Project — Plastic Extrusion Machine (BIUST)**  
  Designed and built a working extrusion system to convert waste plastic into filament for 3D printing. Responsibilities included mechanical design, thermal control, extrusion die design, and prototype validation.

- **Pump Overhaul & Efficiency Upgrade (Debswana)**  
  Led disassembly, inspection, and reassembly of centrifugal pumps; implemented tuning that improved reliability and efficiency.

- **Centralised Greasing System for Loader Trucks (Orapa Mine)**  
  Designed and deployed a centralised lubrication system to standardise maintenance and reduce downtime.

- **SCADA Data Analysis & Diagnostics**  
  Signal review and fault detection using SCADA data; applied MATLAB for trend analysis and basic signal filtering to support maintenance decisions.
